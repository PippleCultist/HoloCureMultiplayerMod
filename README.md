# Holocure Multiplayer Mod
A Holocure mod that adds LAN multiplayer to the game. Will probably be buggy and have random crashes since a lot has been modified in the game to get it working.
## Installation Steps
- Download `HoloCureMultiplayerMod.dll` and `CallbackManagerMod.dll` from the latest version of the mod https://github.com/PippleCultist/HoloCureMultiplayerMod/releases
- Download `AurieManager.exe` from the latest version of Aurie https://github.com/AurieFramework/Aurie/releases
    - Note: This launcher may be marked as a Trojan by your antivirus. Aurie is opensource and has been used in several modding communities without issues.

    - You can find `HoloCure.exe` through Steam by clicking `Browse local files`
- Click `Install Aurie`
